        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p>
            Web development is the work involved in developing a <b>website</b> for the <strong>Internet</strong> 
            (World Wide Web) or an <i>intranet</i> (a private network). Web development can range from <em>developing</em> 
            a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social 
            network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks often referred to as web development may include web 
            engineering, <mark>web design</mark>, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side 
            scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. 
            <del>Traditional web development</del> has evolved significantly. Modern tools have been <ins>introduced</ins> 
            to improve efficiency and productivity. Web development is a <sub>key</sub> aspect of technology that 
            continues to <sup>evolve</sup>.

        <h3>Origin / Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 1.0 refers to the <b>first stage</b> of the World Wide Web's evolution, which was primarily made up of 
            static web pages connected via hyperlinks. It featured <strong>limited interactivity</strong> and was 
            designed to <i>share</i> information. The <em>focus</em> was on delivering content to users rather than 
            engaging them. <mark>Web 1.0</mark> relied heavily on server-side scripting, and dynamic content was 
            <del>non-existent</del>. As the <ins>internet</ins> grew, it paved the way for Web 2.0. Web development 
            during this time also involved the use of <sub>HTML</sub> and <sup>basic CSS</sup>.
        </p>

        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 2.0 introduced <b>user interactivity</b> and dynamic content. Social media platforms, blogs, and 
            collaborative websites became <strong>more prominent</strong>. This era saw a shift towards <i>user-generated</i> 
            content and <em>engagement</em>. <mark>Ajax</mark> and other web technologies enabled <del>traditional, 
            static</del> websites to become more dynamic and responsive. Tools like <ins>JavaScript</ins>, 
            <sub>CSS</sub>, and <sup>HTML5</sup> were widely adopted in this phase.

        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, also known as the <b>Semantic Web</b>, is the <strong>current evolution</strong> in web development. 
            It focuses on <i>machine-readable</i> data and <em>personalized</em> experiences. The <mark>integration</mark> 
            of AI, blockchain, and IoT are prominent features of Web 3.0. Unlike previous versions, it supports 
            decentralized apps and <ins>smart contracts</ins> while enhancing user experiences. Developers rely on 
            <sub>modern frameworks</sub> like React, Vue, and Angular to build <sup>cutting-edge applications</sup>.
